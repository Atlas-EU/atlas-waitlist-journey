    <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Terms of Service – Atlas mobile app</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Effective Date:</strong> 22/7/2025
    </p>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service ("Terms of use", "Terms") constitute a legal agreement between the user and the Atlas mobile application ("App", "Application", "Service"). Please review the following terms carefully before using. By using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms, which rule the user's usage of the Service. If you are not in agreement with these Terms, you must not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">1. Agreement & Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms form a legal agreement between you and the developer ("we", "us"). The Service is intended only for individuals who have reached the legal age of majority in their jurisdiction (typically 18+). If you are underage, you are not permitted to use this app.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">2. Features & Usage</h2>
    <p>
      Atlas is a local workout planner that stores all training data on your device. No user accounts or remote backups are required. You may optionally benefit from features powered by third-party services, including Google Analytics, Crashlytics, and RevenueCat.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The App is designed and expected to be used on a single device per user. If you wish to use your data on a different device, you must use the backup/export and restore/import functionality available as a Pro feature. This allows you to export your data from one device and import it into another.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We do not take any responsibility for loss or corruption of data during the export/import process, or if the user did not use the same version of the app on both devices as advised in the app during this process. The user is solely responsible for ensuring the integrity and compatibility of their data and app versions. Any loss of data, corruption, or incompatibility is not the responsibility of Atlas or its developers.
    </p>

    <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2">3. In-App Purchases & Subscription Terms</h2>
    <p>
      The App offers optional purchases such as Pro subscriptions (monthly, yearly, or lifetime). Payments are processed through Apple or Google Play, with RevenueCat handling subscription status.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      All transactions are subject to their respective refund and cancellation policies:

      We reserve the right to terminate or restrict your access to the Service at any time, with or without notice, if we believe you have violated these Terms or used the App improperly.
